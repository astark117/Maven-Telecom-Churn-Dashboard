# Maven-Telecom-Churn-Dashboard
Churn analysis for Maven Telecom from 2016-2022

I created a SQLite database containing two tables customer_churn and zipcode_population.
I imported the sqlite3 package into python to run my queries on this database.

I ran sql queries to calculate KPIs like Revenue Loss to Churn, Churn Rate, and New Customers, as well as to identify the main drivers of churn. I provided recommendations to increase customer retention based off my findings.

I used my output csv files to build a [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anthony.stark3004/viz/MavenTelecomCustomerChurnAnalysis_16776224705730/Dashboard1?publish=yes) you can view on my Tableau Public Page.
