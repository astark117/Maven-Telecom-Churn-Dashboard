# Maven-Telecom-Churn-Dashboard
Churn analysis for Maven Telecom from 2016-2022

I created a SQLite database containing two tables customer_churn and zipcode_population.
I imported the sqlite3 package into python to run my queries on this database.

I used my output csv files to build a Tableau Dashboard you can view on my Tableau Public Page:
